Enable Dedicated Preview
This option enables previewing charts with dedicated preview audio files (e.g. #PREVIEW, preview*.ogg).\nIf disabled, the preview audio is ignored and Direct Preview is used instead.
Enable Direct Preview
This option enables previewing charts without any dedicated preview audio files, by loading the chart and its keysounds (same as LR2 preview).\nThis method may be relatively slow on regular BMS, since all keysound wavs should be loaded beforehand.
